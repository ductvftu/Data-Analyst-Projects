# DATA ANALYST PROJECTS
This Repository contains my projects within my Data Analyst nanodegree program on Udacity.
The Projects are done with some guidances of the intructors and are eveluated to meet certain requirements for my graduation of the program. The dataset are provided by the platform.

## P1: Investigate a Dataset
Analyze a dataset and communicate your findings about it. Use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib. Go through the whole data analysis process from posing questions about the data to presenting your answers based on the analysis.
## P2: Analyze A/B Test Results
Understand and make a decision about A/B test results of a new webpage.
## P3: Wrangle and Analyze Data
Gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. Document your wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, plus showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python.
## P4: Communicate Data Findings
Use Python visualization libraries to systematically explore a selected dataset, starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables. Produce a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships that you discovered in your selected dataset. Convey your findings through transforming your exploratory visualizations from the first part into polished, explanatory visualizations in the presentation.
